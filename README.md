# 🛠️ TP Design Patterns Lab

This project showcases multiple design patterns in Java, with implementations for the Strategy, Bridge, Decorator, and Adaptor patterns. Each pattern has its own example demonstrating unique design principles. 

## 📖 Project Overview

### Patterns Implemented
1. **Strategy Pattern**: Demonstrates sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort) with two variations in data handling between the context and strategy.
2. **Bridge Pattern**: Separates abstraction from implementation, allowing them to vary independently. 
3. **Decorator Pattern**: Dynamically adds behavior to objects by wrapping them in decorator classes. 
4. **Adaptor Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by creating an adapter. 

## 🌟 Features
- **Design Patterns**: Clear examples of Strategy, Bridge, Decorator, and Adaptor patterns.
- **Flexible Implementations**: Shows various approaches within each pattern.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
Ensure Java is installed:
```bash
java -version
```

### 🏃 Compilation and Execution

1. Navigate to the specific pattern's folder (e.g., `Bridge`, `Decorator`, `Adaptor`, or `src/Strategy/Approach1`).
2. Compile Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the example:
   ```bash
   java MainClassName  # Replace with the main class name of each pattern
   ```

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/Strategy`: Sorting algorithms using the Strategy Pattern.
  - `Approach1`: Context passes data to the strategy.
  - `Approach2`: Strategy accesses data from context.
- `src/Bridge`: Separates abstraction from implementation.
- `src/Decorator`: Adds behavior to objects dynamically.
- `src/Adaptor`: Connects incompatible interfaces.
