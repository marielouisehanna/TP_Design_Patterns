# 🚀 Strategy Design Pattern Lab

This project demonstrates two implementations of the **Strategy Design Pattern** in Java. We use a simple sorting example with **Bubble Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and a new sorting method, **Merge Sort**.

## 📁 Structure

- **Approach 1**: The context class (`Sorter`) passes the data to the sorting strategy explicitly. 📝
- **Approach 2**: The strategy holds a reference to the context class (`Sorter`) to access the data. 🔄
- **New Sort**: A third sorting method, **Merge Sort**, is added to both approaches. ⚡

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

1. Navigate to the `src/Approach1` or `src/Approach2` directories. 📂
2. Compile the Java files using `javac *.java`. 💻
3. Run the main program using `java StrategyPatternExample`. ▶️
